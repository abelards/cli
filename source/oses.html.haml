      %h3 Access

      %p
        For each of these operating systems, you can find the precompiled binaries at the following URL:
      
      %p
        â†’
        %a{href: 'https://github.com/Scalingo/cli/releases'}https://github.com/Scalingo/cli/releases

      %h3 Dependencies

      %p
        As the Scalingo client is developped with Go, the binaries are self sufficient, you have no
        external dependency to install.
